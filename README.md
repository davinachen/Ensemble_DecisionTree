# Ensemble_DecisionTree
This repo serves as part of the Ensemble Learning course project, with a goal of implementing a Decision Tree from scratch on Python allowing us to deal with both regression and classification task

# Files
1. algorithm.py contains main code defining the decision tree
2. Classification.ipynb contains index classification task using Body Mass Index dataset
3. Regression.ipynb contains height prediction regression task using Body Mass Index dataset
4. 500_Person_Gender_Height_Weight_Index.csv contains Body Mass Index dataset including 4 coulmns (Gender, Height, Weight and Index)

# Credits
