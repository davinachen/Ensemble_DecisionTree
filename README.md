# Ensemble_DecisionTree
This repo serves as part of the Ensemble Learning course project, with a goal of implementing a Decision Tree from scratch on Python allowing to deal with both a regression task and a classification task

# Files
1. helper.py includes basic functions that can be called for determining the best split in a decision tree task
2. algorithm.py (undone)
3. prediction.py (undone)
4. Classification.ipynb includes email classification task using the decision tree built (undone)
5. Regression.ipynb includes airbnb price prediction regression task using the decision tree built (undone)
6. Classification_test.ipynb includes how the helper.py was developed based on a simple example (so far, undone)
